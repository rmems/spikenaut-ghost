//! Bio-inspired ghost trading engine with cellular ATP energy metaphors.
//!
//! Ghost trading simulates a multi-asset portfolio without real funds,
//! using biological energy concepts to constrain position sizing:
//!
//! - **ATP** (`CELLULAR_ATP = 500 quote units`) — total available energy
//! - **Energy commitment** (8% per signal) — fraction risked per trade
//! - **Metabolic cost** (0.1% per action) — friction / spread simulation
//!
//! All trades are logged to JSONL for SNN training data and performance analysis.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! Extracted from Eagle-Lander, the author's own private neuromorphic GPU supervisor repository (closed-source).
//! The ghost trading engine ran in production for multi-asset portfolio optimization before being open-sourced
//! as a standalone library.
